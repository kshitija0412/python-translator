# python-translator

I have created a text and speech translator using python.
This translator records the speech thorugh your device mic and displays it int he form of text.
The language of original speech is identified and displayed.
The recorded speech is translated to Spanish (for now) and the translated text is displayed.
The displayed text is converted to audio and we hear the translated audio output.
